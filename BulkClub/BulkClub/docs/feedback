1) case sensitive header names
2) constructor and destructor - always declaration+definition or not at all.
Item() = default()
3) no unused variables!!!
4) always return if the method returns sth
5) don't hardcode file names (especially absolute paths)
6) class for sth with methods+variables, structs for only variables
7) Smart pointer for pointer inside a class. 
Item* should be const inside Sale so it cannot change it.
8) NO C-style MACROS!!! Use const and constexpr instead
9) Provide better comments for reviewers
